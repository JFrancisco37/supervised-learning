## üìç Assignment Overview

This assignment is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Linear Regression (from scratch)

Implementation of linear regression using gradient descent to predict farm prices in Alegrete based on land area. The dataset is fictional and contains two columns: land area (hectares) and price (thousands of BRL).

**Files**:
- `alegrete.py`: contains the implementation of `compute_mse`, `step_gradient`, and `fit`.
- `alegrete.ipynb`: used to load and visualize the dataset and the training process.

**Best parameters**:
- Initial values:  
  `b = ...`  
  `w = ...`  
- Learning rate (`alpha`): `...`  
- Number of iterations: `...`  
- Final MSE: `...`

### 2. Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras

Experiments using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification on the following datasets:

- MNIST
- Fashion MNIST
- CIFAR-10
- CIFAR-100

**File**: `Trabalho_redes_neurais.ipynb`  
Includes the best configurations tested for each dataset.

## üìà Experimental Results

For each dataset, we tested at least 5 different configurations. Below we summarize our reflections and best results.

### Dataset Complexity Ranking (from easiest to hardest)

1. MNIST ‚Äì simple grayscale digits, low intra-class variation.  
2. Fashion MNIST ‚Äì slightly more complex due to shape similarity.  
3. CIFAR-10 ‚Äì color images with more visual complexity.  
4. CIFAR-100 ‚Äì high number of classes and small image size makes classification harder.

### Best Accuracies and Observations

- **MNIST**: XX% ‚Äì Improved with 2 dense layers and ReLU activation.  
- **Fashion MNIST**: XX% ‚Äì Batch normalization helped.  
- **CIFAR-10**: XX% ‚Äì Convolutional layers improved performance.  
- **CIFAR-100**: XX% ‚Äì Performance improved with dropout and deeper CNNs.
